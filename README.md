# Vextrove's Terrain Datapack
This datapack improves upon the default terrain by adding more variety to the types of stone you will find underground.
It also adds several world types, in the form of new dimensions.
Additionally, it adds some minor gameplay modifications, such as:
 - You can use [most stone types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/items/stone_crafting_materials.json) as a substitute for cobblestone when crafting
 - You can climb [more blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/climbable.json), such as fences and chains. You will be able to climb the fence, but you still won't be able to jump over!
 - Endermen can pick up [a wide variety of blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/enderman_holdable.json)
 - [Deepslate blocks burn soulfire.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/deepslate_soul_fire.png) Why? ~~Grimstone.~~ I don't know.

### Lush Caverns
![A lush cavern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/lush_cavern.png "A lush cavern")

## To-do List
 - Randomize giant speleothem parameters
 - Look into outer End island mob spawns
 - Underground trees
 - Underground Lilypads in Swamp
 - Look into increasing the maximal tree height
 - Look into getting structures to generate above y: 128 in the Nether
 - Look into adjusting the tool type and tier block tags
 - Learn more about structures/custom structures so I can use them to do cool things
 - Look into generating obsidian on top of blackstone near the bottom
 - Get Soulsand Valley to generate rare Skeleton skulls on the floor again
 - Generate Shroomlight on the underground Mushroom Island ceiling
 - Check if open bedrock at the bottom of the Nether
 - Generate large quartz crystals in the highest part of the Nether Wastes
 - Figure out if it is possible to get brown Mooshrooms to spawn on Mushroom Islands
 - Look into possibilities to optimize the Soulsand Valley/Basalt Delta ceiling configuration
 - Look into a more elegant way of increasing the amount of fire in the Nether
 - Get Beta terrain working as intended
 - Make better use of 4064 block tall world (colossal mountains?)
### Add images
 - Cavern world
 - Mountain quartz
 - Better badlands cave picture

## Minecraft suggestions
This is my personal list of suggestions for Minecraft. Most of these are my own, however a couple of them came from other people.
Roughly ordered from greatest to worst

### Altitude-dependent biome generation
 - Different biomes generate at different heights
 - It appears this will be implemented in 1.18 with the new mountains, and hopefully the upcoming cave biomes as well
### Directional damage (Fix MC-26678)
### Ghast fireball charging animation (Fix MC-165038)
### Skin customization depending on environment
 - e.g. miner outfit when underground, diver outfit when underwater, warm outfit in cold biomes, beach outfit in beach biomes, etc.
### Connected chains moving like slime/honey blocks when pushed
### Sounds
 - Brick blocks with netherbrick sound
 - Unique sound for Cobblestone
 - Enchanting Table (magical sound)
 - Unique sound for Clay
### Dynamic biomes
 - e.g. plant a lot of Jungle trees to create artificial Jungle biome, snow to create a cold biome, etc.
 - Special variations depending on the dimension the biome is in, e.g Hot Jungle Biome (Red foliage? Special mobs?)
### Hoes take time to till soil
 - Higher tiers are faster
### Different mining 'crack' patterns depending on what block is being broken and/or what tool is being used
 - Logs + Axe: cutting pattern
### Different mining animations for different tools
 - Shovel: Digging motion
 - Pickaxe: Swinging motion
 - Axe: Chopping motion
 - Hoe
### Lava + Sand = Glass
### Vertical rails
### Elder Prismarine
 - Prismarine with the Elder Guardian color palette
 - Can be crafted into Elder Prismarine Brick blocks
### Frosted glass
 - The opposite of tinted glass; an opaque block that lets through light.
 - Crafted by resmelting glass blocks
 - Comes in all colors
### Soul Sandstone?
 - Brown bricks
### Hoes break crops/tall grass/leaves in a 3x3 area
 - Range might be increased with enchantments
### Hoes only destroy fully grown crops
### Infinity on water/lava buckets
### Boomerang
 - Makes a circular motion
 - With enchantments, it can hit more than one target without falling
### Eye block
 - Activates by entities looking at it
 - Looking at the center causes a stronger Redstone signal output (like the Target block)
### Moving platform block
 - Moves horizontally or vertically
 - Entities can stand on them without falling off
### Teleporters
 - Have to be synced up with each other
### Stacked Dispenser crafting recipe: Bow recipe with Dropper in middle
### Random block picker
 - Some builds use a palette of multiple blocks to create a textured surface - an example of this are the Nylium/Netherwart surfaces in Netherwart forests. This item would greatly help create such patterns.
### Lighting
 - Lighting emitting entities
 - Colored light
### Biome-dependent/altitude ambient noises
 - Birds
 - Wind
### Seasons
  Can be implemented simply by cycling through four grass/leave color palettes over time
### Orange Autumn trees
### Pink Sakura (cherry blossom) trees
### Dynamic cloud patterns (A moving random noise map, multiplied by a heightmap of the terrain)
 - This will make it so that clouds will not go through solid terrain
### Stone types
 - Sandstone caves
 - Marble caves
 - Limestone caves
 - Frozen caves
### Increase amount of inventory slots
 - One or two rows would be great
### Mob texture variations (should be distinguishable, like red and brown Mooshrooms, but not like horses)
 - Black and white cows
 - Fully brown cows
 - 'Duck' Chickens
### Inventory 'sort' button
### Cave biomes
 - Slimy cave biome
### Speaker block
 - Plays sounds
### Chorus 'grass' block
 - Grows on the bottom side of Endstone instead of on the top side
### Fence Post
 - A singular fence type that doesn't connect to surrounding blocks
### Wall Post
 - A singular wall type that doesn't connect to surrounding blocks
### Look through Nether portals
### Vertical Slabs
 - I never liked slabs, but now that they are here you might as well add vertical slabs. Placement would be hell
### Dual-type slabs
 - Maybe
### Slime fluid
 - Even higher viscosity than lava, meaning it flows even slower than lava and even 
 - Bounces the player back up
 - Could be used in the Nether as a substitute for MLG water bucketing
