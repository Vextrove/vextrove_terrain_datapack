# Vextrove's Terrain Datapack
This datapack improves upon the default terrain by adding more variety to the types of stone you will find underground.
The world is 384 blocks tall, ranging from y: -64 to y: 320.
It also adds several world types, in the form of new dimensions.
Additionally, it adds some minor gameplay modifications, such as:
 - You can use [most stone types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/items/stone_crafting_materials.json) as a substitute for cobblestone when crafting. For tools, you *can't* use all of these but *most* of these.
 - You can climb [more blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/climbable.json), such as fences and chains. You will be able to climb the fence, but you still won't be able to jump over!
 - You need Iron tools or better to mine in the Deepslate layer
 - Some blocks require different tools than normal to be mined: [Pickaxe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/pickaxe.json) [Axe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/axe.json) [Shovel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/shovel.json) [Hoe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/hoe.json) [Sword](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/sword.json)

![A large river](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/river.png "A large river")
A world 1024 blocks in height. Ranges from -256 to 768
### Max (laggy)
A world 4064 blocks in height, the highest amount possible. Ranges from -2032 to 2032. I dare you to spelunk all the way to the bottom. Reaching -2000 counts as a win. Bonus points if you can do it without mining any deepslate! Either way, it will probably take you over an hour. How fast can it be done? 
### Beta (doesn't work yet)
A recreation of Minecraft 1.7.3 terrain. Will likely range from -64 to 128
### The Aether
![Forgotten Highlands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/aether.png)
![An Irradiated Forest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/irradiated_forest.png)

A 1024 block tall floating islands world. Ranges from -256 to 768
### Caverns
A 512 block tall cave world. Ranges from -128 to 384

## To-do List
 - Fix dimensions
 - Update density functions
 - Update images
 - Update underground foliage
 - Add back skylands and aether
 - Ensure everything looks as it did previously

 - Underground Snow in icy biomes
 - Optimize stone type generation
 - Look into generating different biomes at different vertical levels in the Nether
 - Get Soulsand Valley to generate Skeleton skulls
 - Generate large quartz crystals in the highest part of the Nether Wastes
 - Get Chorus Trees to generate underneath overhangs
 - Investigate Coral
 - Figure out why Swamps are generating so damn many small Brown Mushrooms
 - Figure out why Mushroom Fields don't generate small red mushrooms
 - Generate Shroomlight on the underground Mushroom Island ceiling
 - Underground Lilypads in Swamp
 - Look into increasing variation in tree height
 - Get Beta terrain dimension
 - Learn about custom structures

### Reconsider
 - Raise cloud height in the 1024 and 4064 block tall world types - Cloud height is hard-coded (last checked 21w20a)
 - Get structures to generate above y: 128 (particularly in the Nether) - Structures are hard-coded to generate at specific ranges of y levels (last checked 21w20a) 
 - Get [Brown Mooshrooms](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/4/4e/Brown_Mooshroom_JE2.png) to spawn naturally on Mushroom Islands - Can't configure mob spawns with specific data values (last checked 21w20a)
 - Get Mooshrooms to spawn in the Nether Wastes - They seem to *need* Mycelium and a certain light level in order to spawn, and this can't be customized (last checked 21w20a)
 - Underground trees - The game won't generate trees where there is no light (last checked 21w20a)
 - Get [Chicken Jockey Towers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/5/51/Chicken_Jockey_Tower.png) to spawn - Can't configure mobs to spawn riding other mobs (last checked 21w20a)
Please let me know if any of this has changed!

## Resource pack/Datapack recommendations
 - [Lime's Advancements datapack](https://github.com/slicedlime/LimesAdvancements)
This datapack adds many new achievements to the game! It was created by a Mojangster
 - [myuusubi's FabulousHDR resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fabulous-hdr)
This resource pack adds a HDR shader that increases the dynamic range of the visuals of the game. This really makes the visuals 'pop'. Recommended with the 'Brightness' setting set to 'Moody'

## Minecraft ideas
This is my personal list of ideas of things to add to Minecraft. Most of these are my own, however a couple of them came from other people.
Roughly ordered from best to worst, based on how good the concept is and how much I like it, divided by how difficult I expect it would be to implement.
Some of the worse ideas are higher up in the list than they should be, due to being grouped together with other ideas
These ideas are here so they may inspire me when adding features to this datapack.

### Chainstone
 - [Suggested by gnembon/SciCraft](https://youtu.be/8UB0w8pbJ1Q)
 - Great steampunk vibes!
### Ignore tall grass when attacking entities
### An option to disable the warning when generating a world with custom settings
### Ghast charging fireball animation (Fix MC-165038)
### Water on top of lava forms tuff rather than Cobblestone
### Dynamic cloud patterns (A moving random noise map, multiplied by a heightmap of the terrain)
 - This will make it so that clouds will not go through solid terrain
### Stacked Dispenser crafting recipe (Bow recipe with a Dropper in the middle)
 - [Suggested by ilmango](https://www.youtube.com/c/ilmango)/SciCraft
### Lava can create source blocks in the Nether
 - Renewable Lava
### Skin customization depending on environment
 - e.g. miner outfit when under y: 0, diver outfit when submerged in water, warm outfit in cold biomes

### Inventory:
#### Increase amount of inventory slots
 - One or two additional rows would be great
#### Inventory sort button
### Enable datapacks to add custom blocks
### Lava "melts" blocks it comes in contact with (like concrete powder)
 - Cobblestone -> Stone
 - Sand -> Sandstone/Glass
 - Red Sand -> Red Sandstone/Glass

### Tools:
#### Tool animations:
##### Different animations for different tools
 - Shovel: Digging motion
 - Pickaxe: Swinging motion
 - Axe: Sideways chopping motion
 - Hoe: Tilling motion
 - Sword: Slashing motion
#### Different mining cracking patterns depending on what block is being broken and/or what tool is being used
 - Logs + Axe: cutting pattern
 - It does not make sense for some blocks to appear to break like they currently do
###### Different animations for different weapons
 - Their current one is good enough, but it would be nice if different weapons had different animations

#### Hoes:
##### Hoes take time to till soil
 - Higher tiers are faster, but tilling shouldn't take too long
 - Different blocks take different times to till
##### Hoes break crops/tall grass/flowers in a 3x3 area
 - Range might be increased with enchantments
##### Hoes only destroy fully grown crops
 - Like how wielding a sword in creative mode prevents you from breaking anything
 
#### Random block picker
 - Some builds use a palette of multiple blocks to create a textured surface - an example of this are the Nylium/Netherwart surfaces in Netherwart forests. This item would greatly help create such patterns.
#### Boomerang
 - Makes a circular motion
 - With enchantments, it can hit more than one target without falling
 - Fits with Minecraft's "medieval" aesthetic
#### Infinity on water/lava buckets - Suggested by unknown
 - Great for building
 - Great for grieving
 - Renewable Lava

### Decorative blocks:
#### Frosted glass
 - The opposite of tinted glass; an opaque block that lets through light.
 - Crafted by resmelting glass blocks
 - Could come in all 16 usual colors
#### Elder Prismarine
 - Prismarine with the Elder Guardian color palette\
#### Dark Prismarine Wall
#### Soul Sandstone
 - Soul Sandstone Brick blocks
#### Red Nether Bricks:
 - Red Nether Bricks has some missing blocks
##### Red Nether Brick Fence
##### Cracked Red Nether Bricks
##### Chiseled Red Nether Bricks
#### Cloud block
 - Transparent cloud-like block for building
#### Fence/Wall Post
 - A wall/fence that doesn't connect to surrounding blocks
#### Dual-type slabs

### Minecarts:
#### Rails don't need a supporting block
 - We would need to be able to stand on rails as well for this to be any good
#### Vertical rails
#### Vertical rails
 - A Minecart would require Powered Rails to go up
#### Increase Furnace Minecart tensile strength
 - Currently Minecarts split up when making a turn

### Terrain generation: 
 - Suggestions for Terrain generation
#### Caves:
 - Suggestions for caves
##### Local stone types
 - [Frozen caves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/frost_cavern.png)
 - [Sandstone caves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/desert_cave.png)
 - [Badlands caves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/mesa_cave.png)
 - Andesite/Diorite/Granite caves
 - Marble caves
 - Limestone caves 
##### Overhaul Slime chunks
 - Needs a visual cue
 - Perhaps remove Slime chunks and replace them with a slime cave biome
#### Autumn biome
 - Orange leaves for autumn builds
#### Pink grass biome
 - Could be in a sky dimension
#### Dynamic biomes
 - e.g. plant a lot of Jungle trees to create artificial Jungle biome, snow to create a cold biome, etc.
 - Special variations depending on the dimension the biome is in, e.g Hot Jungle Biome (Red foliage? Special mobs?)
#### The End:
##### Purpur wood
 - [Purple](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/1/1f/Nether_Portal_%28EW%29_BE.gif) wood
##### Ender wood
 - [Teal](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/f/f6/Ender_Pearl_JE3_BE2.png) wood
 - Color might be too similar to Warped Planks. But then again, we have Crimson and Mangrove, Spruce and Oak, Jungle and Acacia
##### Chorus moss block
 -  Like Grass blocks, but the moss grows on the bottom face of Endstone instead of on the top
 -  Let's call it Chorus/Ender/Purpur Moss, just to differentiate it from grass

### Functional blocks:
 - Suggestions for blocks with special functionality
#### Moving platform block
 - Moves horizontally or vertically
 - Entities can stand on them without falling off
#### Eye block
 - Activates by entities looking at it
 - Looking at the center causes a stronger Redstone signal output (like the Target block)
#### Teleporters
 - Have to be synced up with each other
#### Speaker block
 - Plays sounds

### Entities
#### Slimes:
 - Slime size should scale linearly, not logarithmically
 - Slimes should have an RGB data value
 - Slimes should occasionally spawn underground, especially in Lush Caves (not just in Slime chunks)
 - Slime in a Bucket (catch small slimes)
 - Slimes should rarely spawn at a bigger size
#### Brown Mooshrooms
 - Should spawn naturally

### Sound:
#### Make block sounds .json dependent
#### Sound filtering
 - Underwater - and even more so "underlava" - higher frequencies are filtered out, muffling the sound
#### Echo sound filter
 - Either do a rudimentary calculation of cave size, or enable when skylight level is zero and current altitude is below y: 24
 
#### Block sounds:
 - Give all brick blocks Netherbrick sounds rather than the generic Stone block sound
 - Unique sound for Cobblestone and Raw Metal blocks
 - Enchanting Table (magical sound)
 - Unique sound for Clay
#### Biome and altitude dependent ambient noises
 - Birds in forests and especially jungles
 - Wind high up in the mountains and perhaps in deserts
 - Shore wave sounds coming from the direction of ocean biomes in beach biomes
 

### Mob texture variations (should be distinguishable and recognizable, like red and brown Mooshrooms, but not like horses)
 - Black and white cows
 - Fully brown cows
 - "Duck" Chickens
 
### Lighting:
#### Light emitting entities
#### Colored light
 - Calculate on a separate thread?
### Seasons
 - Can be implemented by cycling through four grass/leave color palettes over time
 - Could possibly affect mobs spawns, like how moon phases affect Slime spawns in Swamps
 - Orange Autumn trees
 - Unknown how this should interplay with biomes, e.g. snowy biomes
