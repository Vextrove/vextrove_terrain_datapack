# Vextrove's Terrain Datapack
This datapack improves upon the default terrain by adding more variety to the types of stone you will find underground.
It also adds several world types, in the form of new dimensions.
Additionally, it adds some minor gameplay modifications, such as:
 - You can use [most stone types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/items/stone_crafting_materials.json) as a substitute for cobblestone when crafting
 - You can climb [more blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/climbable.json), such as fences and chains. You will be able to climb the fence, but you still won't be able to jump over!
 - Endermen can pick up [a wide variety of blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/Vextrove's%20Terrain%20Datapack/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/enderman_holdable.json)
 - [Deepslate blocks burn soulfire.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vextrove/vextrove_terrain_datapack/main/img/deepslate_soul_fire.png) Why? ~~Grimstone.~~ I don't know.

## To-do List
 - Check if there is still open bedrock at the bottom of the lava sea in the Nether
 - Get Soulsand Valley to generate rare Skeleton skulls on the floor again
 - Implement more elegant way of generating fire in the Nether
 - Modify giant speleothem parameters (start from scratch)
 - Generate Shroomlight on the underground Mushroom Island ceiling
 - Underground Lilypads in Swamp
 - Look into optimizing the Soulsand Valley/Basalt Delta ceiling generation
 - Look into increasing the maximal tree height
 - Get Beta terrain working as intended
 - Get structures to generate above y: 128 (particularly in the Nether) - Structures are hard-coded to generate at specific ranges of y levels (last checked 21w19a) 
 - Look into altering the tool type and tier block tags
 - Look into my customized End mob spawns
 - Learn more about structures/custom structures so I can use them to do cool things
### Website
 - Add videos
 - Create Github page
 - Publish datapack on Curseforge
 - Add features implemented in 
#### Add images
 - Cavern world
 - Mountain quartz
 - Better badlands cave picture
### On hold until new customization options become available
 - Get [Brown Mooshrooms](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/4/4e/Brown_Mooshroom_JE2.png) to spawn naturally on Mushroom Islands - Can't configure mob spawns with specific data values (last checked 21w19a)
 - Adjust cloud height in the 1024 and 4064 block tall world types and the Aether dimension - Cloud height is hard-coded (last checked 21w19a)
 - Underground trees - The game won't generate trees where there is no sunlight (last checked 21w19a)
 - Make better use of 4064 block tall world (I have to put my ideal vision on hold due to a minor limitation I'll elaborate on later)
 - Generate large quartz crystals (reskinned large dripstones) in the highest part of the Nether Wastes - Large dripstones are hard-coded to only generate below y: 0 (last checked 21w19a)
 - Get [Chicken Jockey Towers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/5/51/Chicken_Jockey_Tower.png) to spawn - Can't configure mobs to spawn riding other mobs (last checked 21w19a)
Please let me know if any of this has changed!

## Minecraft ideas
This is my personal list of ideas of things to add to Minecraft. Most of these are my own, however a couple of them came from other people.
Roughly ordered from best to worst, based on how good the concept is/how much I like it divided by how difficult I think it would be to implement. That being said, I am not a programmer...
These are here so they may inspire me when adding features to this datapack. Bad ideas will be removed over time.

### Altitude-dependent biome generation
 - Different biomes generate at different heights
 - It appears this will be implemented in 1.18 with the new mountains, and hopefully the upcoming cave biomes as well
### Directional damage (Fix MC-26678)
### Ghast fireball charging animation (Fix MC-165038)
### [Chainstone - Suggested by gnembon/SciCraft](https://youtu.be/8UB0w8pbJ1Q)
 - Great steampunk vibes!
### Water on top of lava forms tuff rather than Cobblestone
### Environment-dependant skins
 - e.g. miner outfit when underground, diver outfit when underwater, warm outfit in cold biomes, beach outfit in beach biomes, etc.
### Hoes take time to till soil
 - Higher tiers are faster, but tilling shouldn't take too long
 - Different blocks take different times to till
### Different mining animations for different tools
 - Shovel: Digging motion
 - Pickaxe: Swinging motion
 - Axe: Sideways chopping motion
 - Hoe: Tilling motion
 - Sword: Slashing motion
#### Attacks require different animations (default one would suffice but isn't ideal)
### Different mining cracking patterns depending on what block is being broken and/or what tool is being used
 - Logs + Axe: cutting pattern
 - It does not make sense for some blocks to appear to break like they currently do
### Vertical rails
### Elder Prismarine
 - Prismarine with the Elder Guardian color palette
 - Can be crafted into Elder Prismarine Bricks
### Frosted glass
 - The opposite of tinted glass; an opaque block that lets through light.
 - Crafted by resmelting glass blocks
 - Comes in "all 16 colors"
### Soul Sandstone?
 + Various Soul Sandstone Brick blocks
### Boomerang
 - Makes a circular motion
 - With enchantments, it can hit more than one target without falling
 - Fits with Minecraft's "medieval" aesthetic
### Lava "melts" blocks it comes in contact with
 - Cobblestone -> Stone
 - Sand -> Sandstone
### Make block sounds resource pack dependent (I have faith this will be added one day)
### Enable datapacks to add custom blocks
### Dynamic biomes
 - e.g. plant a lot of Jungle trees to create artificial Jungle biome, snow to create a cold biome, etc.
 - Special variations depending on the dimension the biome is in, e.g Hot Jungle Biome (Red foliage? Special mobs?)
### Hoes break crops/tall grass/leaves in a 3x3 area
 - Range might be increased with enchantments
### Hoes only destroy fully grown crops
### Infinity on water/lava buckets - Suggested by unknown
### Eye block
 - Activates by entities looking at it
 - Looking at the center causes a stronger Redstone signal output (like the Target block)
### Moving platform block
 - Moves horizontally or vertically
 - Entities can stand on them without falling off
### Teleporters
 - Have to be synced up with each other
### Stacked Dispenser crafting recipe (Bow recipe with a Dropper in the middle) - Suggested by [ilmango](https://www.youtube.com/c/ilmango)/SciCraft
### Random block picker
 - Some builds use a palette of multiple blocks to create a textured surface - an example of this are the Nylium/Netherwart surfaces in Netherwart forests. This item would greatly help create such patterns.
### Echo sound filter
 - Enable when skylight level is zero and current altitude is below y: 24
### Better sound system
 - Sound filtering
 - Could possibly run on a seperate thread? Supposedly Minecraft 
### Light emitting entities
### Colored light
### Biome and altitude dependent ambient noises
 - Birds
 - Wind
 - Shore wave sounds
### Seasons
 - Can be implemented simply by cycling through four grass/leave color palettes over time
 - Could possibly affect mobs spawns, like how moon phases affect Slime spawns in Swamps
### Orange Autumn trees
### Pink Sakura (cherry blossom) trees
### Dynamic cloud patterns (A moving random noise map, multiplied by a heightmap of the terrain)
 - This will make it so that clouds will not go through solid terrain
### Stone types
 - Sandstone caves
 - Marble caves
 - Limestone caves
 - Frozen caves
### Increase amount of inventory slots
 - One or two rows would be great
### Mob texture variations (should be distinguishable, like red and brown Mooshrooms, but not like horses)
 - Black and white cows
 - Fully brown cows
 - "Duck" Chickens
### Inventory sort button
### Cave biomes
 - Slimy cave biome
### Speaker block
 - Plays sounds
### Chorus "grass" block
 - Like Grass blocks, but the grass part grows on the bottom side of Endstone instead of on the top side
### Fence Post
 - A singular fence type that doesn't connect to surrounding blocks
### Wall Post
 - A singular wall type that doesn't connect to surrounding blocks
### Look through Nether portals
 - I don't want to give up on the purple event horizon
### Vertical Slabs
 - I never liked slabs, but now that they are here you might as well add vertical slabs. Placement would be hell
### Dual-type slabs
 - Maybe
### Slime fluid
 - Even higher viscosity than lava, meaning it flows even slower than lava and even 
 - Bounces the player back up
 - Could be used in the Nether as a substitute for MLG water bucketing
